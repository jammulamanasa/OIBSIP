# # TASK-1:IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying iris flowers into their respective species using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree algorithms. The purpose of this project is to illustrate the application of these algorithms in addressing a classic classification problem.

# # DATASET
The project employs the widely recognized Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Due to its straightforward nature and clear species distinctions, this dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for classification algorithms.

# # ALGORITHMS
The classification task is carried out using three well-known algorithms:

1.Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is an effective algorithm for both binary and multi-class classification. It works by constructing a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes to separate data points belonging to different classes, with the aim of maximizing the margin between them.

2.Logistic Regression (LR): LR is a popular algorithm for binary classification that can be extended to handle multi-class scenarios. It models the relationship between the input features and the probabilities of the different classes using a logistic function.

3.Decision Tree: Decision Tree is a tree-structured algorithm that recursively divides the feature space based on the values of the attributes. It generates a set of rules to make predictions by following the tree from the root node to the leaf nodes.
# # USAGE
To execute the classification algorithms and assess their performance, follow these steps:

1.Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

2.Run the iris_classification.py script, which loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the SVM, LR, and Decision Tree models, and evaluates their accuracy on a separate test set.

3.Experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering methods, or other adjustments to enhance the classification performance.

4.Feel free to explore the code, delve into the implementation details, and adapt it for your own classification projects.
# #TASK-2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
This repository contains a data science project focused on analyzing unemployment rates, particularly the significant increase observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this project is to explore the unemployment data, identify trends, and provide insights into the factors affecting unemployment rates.

# # DATASET
The project utilizes a dataset that includes the following columns: Region, Date, Frequency, Estimated Unemployment Rate (%), Estimated Employed, Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%), and Area. This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and provides a comprehensive view of the unemployment situation across various regions and time periods.

# # ANALYSIS STEPS
The analysis is performed using the following steps:

1.Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant data. This step ensures the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is conducted to understand the distribution of unemployment rates, identify trends over time, and visualize the data using charts and graphs.

3.Trend Analysis: The project explores trends in unemployment rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying key periods where significant changes occurred.

4.Correlation Analysis: Correlation analysis is performed to explore relationships between unemployment rates and other economic indicators such as labor participation rates and employment levels.

# # USAGE
To conduct the unemployment analysis and generate insights, follow these steps:

1.Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

2.Run the unemployment_analysis.py script, which loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, and performs exploratory data analysis and trend analysis.

3.Experiment with different visualization techniques, statistical methods, or other approaches to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing unemployment rates.

4.Feel free to explore the code, review the findings, and adapt it for your own data analysis projects.

# #TASK-3: CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices based on a variety of features. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a car, considering factors such as brand reputation, features, horsepower, mileage, and more.

# #DATASET
The project employs a dataset that includes various attributes related to cars, such as the brand, model, year of manufacture, engine size, horsepower, fuel type, mileage, and more. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and testing the machine learning models used in this project.

# #ALGORITHMS
The car price prediction task is carried out using a combination of regression algorithms, which may include:

1.Linear Regression: A simple yet powerful algorithm that models the relationship between the input features and the target variable (car price) by fitting a linear equation.

2.Random Forest Regression: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve the accuracy and robustness of the prediction.

3.Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): An advanced boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially, each correcting the errors of the previous ones, leading to highly accurate predictions.

# #USAGE
