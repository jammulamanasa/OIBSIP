# # TASK-1:IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying iris flowers into their respective species using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree algorithms. The purpose of this project is to illustrate the application of these algorithms in addressing a classic classification problem.
# # DATASET
The project employs the widely recognized Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Due to its straightforward nature and clear species distinctions, this dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for classification algorithms.
# # ALGORITHMS
The classification task is carried out using three well-known algorithms:

1.Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is an effective algorithm for both binary and multi-class classification. It works by constructing a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes to separate data points belonging to different classes, with the aim of maximizing the margin between them.

2.Logistic Regression (LR): LR is a popular algorithm for binary classification that can be extended to handle multi-class scenarios. It models the relationship between the input features and the probabilities of the different classes using a logistic function.

3.Decision Tree: Decision Tree is a tree-structured algorithm that recursively divides the feature space based on the values of the attributes. It generates a set of rules to make predictions by following the tree from the root node to the leaf nodes.
# # USAGE
To execute the classification algorithms and assess their performance, follow these steps:

1.Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

2.Run the iris_classification.py script, which loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the SVM, LR, and Decision Tree models, and evaluates their accuracy on a separate test set.

3.Experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering methods, or other adjustments to enhance the classification performance.

4.Feel free to explore the code, delve into the implementation details, and adapt it for your own classification projects.
